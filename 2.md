#### 2 - Generation

"Do you think she's into me man?" Johnny floated behind Dmitriy, using the rails on the walls of the ship to propel himself forward. Dmitriy rolled his eyes and continued past the lockers, past the tiny windows that looked out into what seemed to be an empty void.

"Nyet. What you care?" Dmitriy answered in his thick Ukrainian accent. "We need to work on assignment. Due tomorrow, remember?"

"I love her, Dima. I tell you, she was looking at me while Mr. Esper was droning on about atomic physics and Feynman diagrams and whatever. I caught her and she looked away again."

"Johnny, pull your head out of ass. Maybe she noticed creep looking at her. We are the future of humanity. Look out there." Dmitriy led Johnny to one of the small windows. Johnny squinted and the stars started appearing into view. And so many stars! The Generation was three months away from Mars, but to these teenagers, this place they had called home for nearly the last two years seemed much more welcoming than a foreboding, deserted, dust-forsaken little red rock. 

"What am I supposed to be looking at? I don't care about any of that future of humanity crap. I want to ask Katie to the dance."

"Good luck with that. She has boyfriend already. I saw them last week in gymnasium."

Johnny didn't believe him, but his stomach dropped all the same. "Whatever. Let's do that stupid physics homework already."

Dmitriy led the way to his place on the gravity spinner. He couldn't help but admire how massive it was, and he knew it was the work of Ukrainian engineers as well. It had always been theorized that a giant spinning ring could be put on a spaceship, and spun at such a speed that the centripetal force would simulate Earth gravity. But the cost and scale were considered huge. However, on this generation ship, no expense was spared; the ship had already been under construction before the takeover of Earth and the spinner was being designed and constructed in the Ukraine. It was considered necessary to have a way to simulate gravity, as experiments and studies showed that human bone rapidly decreased in strength in the zero gravity of space. Although the school and various other structures were not on the spinner, the main dormitories and residences were, to maximize the amount of time humans spent in regular gravity.

To get onto the gravity spinner was a multi-step process. Johnny and Dmitriy had done this so much it was automatic to them, but the spinner was fairly fast and one could get injured if it wasn't done correctly. The spinner had two outer thinner rings that spun at lower speeds to aid in this. They queued up at the boarding station and got on the first, slowest ring. It spun fast enough to simulate about half of moon gravity. They had to transfer quickly to the second and third rings before jumping into the main ring. But once on the main ring, the gravity, about 80% that of Earth's, was enough to keep them healthy for long periods of time. Scientists didn't know for sure, but it was generally believed that humans could have a normal lifespan at 0.8g. 

Dmitriy's room was in the student dormitory block; it was tiny but had a small window to the outside as well. He put the lead cover on the window and turned on his desk lamp.

"Mr. Esper is a total hardass. He wouldn't even let me save my game before he called me up to solve that dynamics problem in front of the whole class."

"You should not play game in class, Johnny."

"But I solved it!"

"You didn't account for coefficient of friction or first-order term at all."

"I know, Mr. Esper said so too. But I get partial credit, right?"

"There is no partial credit when it comes to machines. You're in the wrong place and you die."

Johnny rolled his eyes and daydreamed about Ekaterina from physics class. Not only was she the best student, but he thought also the prettiest. The ratio amongst students was even more skewed than the average in the Generation, with around 65% males, so he knew there was a lot of competition for Katie.

"Hey, stop dreaming, Johnny, let's get started."

Dmitriy opened the thick tome to chapter 7 and looked at the first problem. It was a tricky problem involving a tennis racket spinning under its three different moments of inertia. "Easy", said Dmitriy. "This is Dzhanibekov effect. Angular rotation around second axis is unstable." Dmitriy quickly sketched out the three differential equations describing the motion of the object and had a solution within ten minutes. Johnny followed along but was annoyed and a bit envious of his friend's speed.

"Don't spoil it man. Let me do the next one!"

At that moment, everything went dark, and the spinner started slowing down.

"Another blackout." Dmitriy took out his pocket light and mounted it on the desk.

"Let's just take a break and make sure it's nothing serious, Dima. You know this ship is fragile. Also, as we get farther from the sun, electricity output goes down and we keep using too much of it."

"It's probably cloaker. It draws too much power and it is most important so everything else must turn off."

"Doesn't it worry you that we have to keep turning the cloaker on? Why don't they even tell us why they're doing it?"

Dmitriy sighed. "Johnny, cloaker makes us invisible to electromagnetic spectrum. There must be some reason why we want to be invisible to electromagnetic spectrum."

"Yes, like, the machines are looking for us? Are they nearby? Did we see them? Why can they not spot us?"

"As you know, machine doesn't have eyes like you and I do. There's nothing preventing them from developing ocular sensors, but that is just a small part of the total spectrum. Machine scans for us in infrared, and lower radio waves. Cloaker blocks radar. Solar panels are highly reflective but we close those down as well during the cloaking."

"Do you think they would actually do anything if they spotted us?"

"Maybe not. We are like bug to machines. You wouldn't hurt spider once you kicked it out of your room. But it would be hassle to send ships over to hurt us. Besides, we have defenses. We could spot them and run away or fight back."

Johnny felt slightly less anxious and looked at the next problem under the dim light of the lamp. This one was about a toilet paper roll. If you push it just so that it starts unrolling, figure out the speed at the end. There's the coefficient of friction he missed earlier, plus the decreasing potential energy as the center of mass got closer to the floor! Johnny relished these types of problems. He started sketching out a solution, but Dmitriy seemed to be lost in thought.

"Johnny, do you know why machines even wanted to kill us? It's not like Terminator or Matrix or any of those movies from last century. Machines are not evil, they don't want to get into a war with us or use us for energy. Machines don't even think of us. It is like we are bug to them."

"You said that already, Dima. I get it, though. At the park, you don't go out of your way to stomp on anthills. Only if they are in your way. Otherwise, you don't think about what the ants are doing on any given day. You are only concerned with living your own life."

"What is machine concerned with?", Dmitriy posited. "I don't think anyone exactly understands."

Now it was Johnny who prodded his inquisitive but stubborn friend into completing the assignment. The lights came back on shortly after, and they continued. They felt gravity quickly come back to normal as the spinner sped up again. Much of the furniture in their small rooms was bolted down for these fairly frequent occurrences.

After about 30 minutes, they decided to take a break and walked out to the convenience store down the block.

"I've been thinking", said Johnny. "As Mr. Zamansky told us in our computer science class, the first general artificial intelligence arose out of some experiments starting in 2015. Actually, let's go further back. Remember Deep Blue? You would know this."

"Yes, Kasparov. He's not Ukrainian, you know."

"Yes, of course. Deep Blue was a milestone in artificial intelligence. It's the first time that a machine beat a top player at a game of skill as complex as chess. It was massive, consumed megawatts of power, and all of its functionality was available in a handheld device 10 years later. But all the chess computer was good at was playing chess. It evaluated and pruned the massive tree of chess positions so that it could figure out the best way to win. The algorithm was actually not even that complex. The programmers could almost explain to a layperson how it worked."

Dmitriy and picked up a bag of beef jerky and handed over his payment card to the clerk. The register rang up 15 credits.

"I only have 100 credits left for remainder of week, Johnny. Want to go down to the training room later to make some more?"

"Yes, but please first let me continue my point."

"I know where this is going."

"Dima, I think I know how to keep the machines from hurting us."

"Continue", Dmitriy said in his thick accent.

"The most challenging board game for a machine to master was always seen as the ancient board game Go. The number of possible positions dwarfs that of chess and is many orders of magnitude bigger than the total number atoms in the universe. It is also very difficult to even evaluate how a game is going. The best humans were always lightyears ahead of the top computers.

At some point, a company took it upon themselves to create an artificial intelligence for Go. But instead of using alpha-beta pruning, or any of those old techniques, it modeled the human brain, very primitively of course."

"Yes, neural network."

"Yes, exactly. They trained a network of neurons, really just virtual constructs, on top Go players' games, and started teaching them to play based on these. Applying different weights to the different neurons, and repeating the training process, and so on, eventually led to a program that could defeat some of the lower-level Go players. Finally, in 2016, there was a match against a top professional that was aired all around the world, and the program won convincingly, 4-1."

"Johnny, people behind you."

Johnny paid 20 credits for his recycled water and kale chips and walked with his friend out of the store. The clerk seemed slightly disappointed, as the conversation was getting interesting.

"That's not all. They started training that program further to the point where it beat the top player in the world 3-0. The thing is, no one really knew how it worked. There were a few times when the program made a move that no one would have thought possible, and the programmers themselves could not explain their creation. And upon later examination, it was clear these moves were brilliant."

"Right. Neural network is like black box. You put input, it spit output, and it's all simple threshold equations. Ones and zeros. Sigmoids."

"But even that's not all. They were working on another experiment. Instead of teaching the computer how to play Go by analyzing games, they started from first principles. Just have the programs play each other randomly, and strategy will evolve. The computer started coming up with novel strategies no human had ever used, and after a few days of training, became strong enough to beat the computer that had defeated the world's top player 100-0." Johnny paused for emphasis. "ONE HUNDRED TO ZERO. All of this on much cheaper hardware."

Dmitriy wasn't impressed since he'd heard all of this before. But Johnny had a point.

"So", Johnny continued. "We went from middling computers who could barely beat amateur Go players, to one that beat a professional, to one that crushed the world's best, to one that utterly dominated the computer that crushed the world's best, all in 2 years. Dima, how much do you know about exponential growth?"

Dmitriy felt insulted by the question. "Seriously? We study this in physics last week. Exponential decay of radioactive material, but same concept. What is your point?"

"The point, Dima, the point is that as good as that program got, it was still only good at one thing, playing Go. But, its strategies were ... human-like for lack of a better term. If you can't understand what it's doing, was it actually thinking, like us?"

"Are you suggesting machines that took over world are only good at one thing?"

"Yes! What they were programmed to do. Go was considered solved in 2017, and the next experiments were in a game called Starcraft 2."

"Yes, I heard about that game. My dad used to have on his computer."

"The game was considered a good game for a more general artificial intelligence. It was a real-time strategy game that simulated war, a game of incomplete information as you never knew everything that your opponent was doing, but could figure it out by judicious scouting."
