#### 2 - Generation

"Do you think she's into me man?" Johnny ran after Dmitriy, who rolled his eyes and continued walking past the lockers, past the tiny windows that looked out into what seemed to be an empty void.
"Nyet. What you care?" Dmitriy answered in his thick Ukrainian accent. "We need to work on assignment. Due tomorrow, remember?"
"I love her, Dima. I tell you, she was looking at me while Mr. Esper was droning on about atomic physics and Feynman diagrams and whatever. I caught her and she looked away again."
"Johnny, pull your head out of ass. Maybe she noticed creep looking at her. We are the future of humanity. Look out there." Dmitriy led Johnny to one of the small windows. Johnny squinted and the stars started appearing into view. And so many stars! The Generation was three months away from Mars, but to these teenagers, this place they had called home for nearly the last two years seemed much more welcoming than a foreboding, deserted, dust-forsaken little red rock. 
"What am I supposed to be looking at? I don't care about any of that future of humanity crap. I want to ask Katie to the dance."
"Good luck with that. She has boyfriend already. I saw them last week in gymnasium."
Johnny didn't believe him, but his stomach dropped all the same. "Whatever. Let's do that stupid physics homework already."

Dmitriy led the way to his place on the gravity spinner. He couldn't help but admire how massive it was, and he knew it was the work of Ukrainian engineers as well. It had always been theorized that a giant spinning ring could be put on a spaceship, and spun at such a speed that the centripetal force would simulate Earth gravity. But the cost and scale were considered huge. However, on this generation ship, no expense was spared; the ship had already been under construction before the takeover of Earth and the spinner was being designed and constructed in the Ukraine. It was considered necessary to have a way to simulate gravity, as experiments and studies showed that human bone rapidly decreased in strength in the zero gravity of space.
