### Takeover

#### 1 - Phobos

Peter had the foreboding sense that this day had already occurred. It wasn't quite deja vu, but a much more vague, uncomfortable feeling of doom. He stared out the thick, round window of his bedroom as yet another sandstorm started batting down upon the station, quickly blocking out the tiny Phobos making its way across the Martian sky, and wondered just how strong the construction was and whether the eventual erosive damage would cause complete structural failure as he slept.

The ship that he had arrived on 3 Earth years before was inside its makeshift hangar a few hundred meters away, and without any propellant nor a way to generate any, he was stuck on this godforsaken planet until the Generation arrived. Of course, there was no going back to Earth anyway, but he desperately needed human interaction, and the periodic messages he received on his videotex could barely fit the bill.

He reviewed the last videotex message again. The captain of the Generation, James Morrow, was a balding, imperious, and positive man, who radiated confidence as he spoke. James started every message the same, by relaying his current coordinates to Peter; the computer onboard the ship was purposefully simple and its star sensor dutifully printed out the coordinates on screen. Given the position of several stars and planets, as well as their parallax minutes later, the position of the ship could be figured out to enough accuracy where Peter was sure that at its current speed the ship was no more than 3 months away.

Turning on the videotex always shot a tinge of fear through Peter. The air gap was at least the distance from Earth, although he knew they surely had figured out how to launch spaceships by now and were surely on their way to Mars. Since they were so much more intelligent they may have figured out a wireless way. The videotex had a radio in order to receive messages from the Generation; all messages were encrypted with military-grade technology that would apparently take more than the age of the universe to break. But, Peter wondered, what if you harnessed the entire energy of the planet to put them to this singular purpose?

James then went through all of the relevant statistics for his ship. These messages were beamed out to all of the various colonies in the system: there was one on Ceres, Peter's own Martian colony, apparently one in the clouds of Venus, and Titan was the last one he was aware of. Attempts to establish colonies in Europa and Mercury had failed, and the moon was way too close to Earth to even consider. Still, there were a few rebels on the Moon deep underground, on an encrypted channel, but with no way to radio back out lest they be quickly located by the Earth-bound scanners. 

"Last week's roll showed 4,117 people on this ship. Youngest is 37 days old, oldest is 53 years old. 2239 men and 1878 women. We have been journeying for 458 Earth days. Oxygen levels and water levels are good, the Generation's greenhouse and filtration units are doing just fine. There was a slight anomaly with the gravity spinner and a technician fixed it. Several of the motors were running too hot and just needed an oil change." 

Peter knew that most of those aboard were American, but there were also people from various other large countries: the second biggest population were Chinese, then a contingent of Russians, Indians, Japanese, Indonesians, Brazilians, and others. The USA had quickly put together a list of 2,500 people that it deemed most fit to restart life anew, amidst the quick falling apart of civilization (and humanity) other countries had also done the same, but with a total capacity of 4,000, the Generation was definitely feeling the overcrowding. Three babies had already been born on board the ship, but it was still mostly self-sustaining. Food was grown in several large greenhouses; the entire ship was shielded from radiation by a thick recycled water layer. Lithium hydroxide scrubbers made the air safe to breathe, and they had enough to last for another year if so needed.

Peter knew that it was his responsibility to ready the planet for the coming Generation. Approximately five years before, he and 6 other astronauts had hastily set out in ships to various destinations in the Solar System, as the American government realized they were in an unwinnable, likely humanity-ending war. The machines, if you could even call them that, were beginning to overwhelm the best American and world defenses, and it was only a matter of time before they got their hands on a nuclear bomb. When he arrived, after two years of travel, he had barely enough materials to keep himself alive while he built a shelter into the side of a suitable dune. The ship itself crash-landed due to a miscalculation - all calculations had to be done on board the ship as Earth went dark a few months after launch - although the crash itself was not at great speed, it damaged the ship's propellant tank. Most of the remaining propellant evaporated and otherwise dissipated in the thin Martian atmosphere. This lack of fuel rendered the rover on the ship useless, which meant Peter had no choice but to remain within a few hundred meters of the ship. Luckily, the dune nearby seemed sufficiently strong to put up the aluminum dome armature against the side of it. It had suffered no damage, and it only took about 6 hours for it to be solidly affixed to the dune and the ground using the automated boring screws and tunnel digger on board. At least this machine was simple and did as it was told.

His oxygen generator was the only thing keeping him alive; as long as the sun shone, and it did - the Martian day is only slightly longer than the Earth night - it could generate enough to support him for a few days. He quickly got to work on the greenhouse to generate the rest of his supplemental oxygen. His ship had plenty of plants and in his pre-launch briefing and videos he watched while in transit he had learned enough about how to irrigate and fertilize the arid Martian soil. The ship carried 3 years of canned and otherwise packaged food; he'd have to grow the rest and wait for more supplies from any ships headed his way. Since Earth had stopped answering his messages over a year ago, it was not for another few months that he finally heard the beep of his videotex. He was sleeping fitfully, dreaming of the blue Santa Barbara sky, when he heard the beep. At first, he thought it was his alarm, but this beep was different. He recognized it while still half awake, and he jumped out of bed, almost hitting his head on the exposed rock from the dune, ran to the videotex, and saw the first of Captain James Morrow's messages to him.

"Captain James Morrow of the Generation here. We have launched from what remains of Earth one month ago, and carry 4,114 souls aboard, including myself. We are coming to Mars to establish a base, to repopulate humanity, and one day, we will take back our planet from _them_."
